    <h2>About Me: Kayla, Owner of Forever Love Pet Care</h2>

    <p>Kayla is an animal lover who is also very creative. She loves spending time with her husband, dog (River) and cat (luna). In her spare time she enjoys making crafts and spending time with family.</p>

    <p>She was born and raised in Loveland where she was constantly around animals. Over that time caring for animals quickly became her passion. Kayla always knew she wanted a future with animals but didn’t know the director she wanted to go with it.</p>

    <p>After high school she went to cosmetology school to become a hair stylist. After two years the initial feeling of excitement was dimmed as she realized cosmetology wasn’t for her. so she moved on and got a job in retail. As you can guess, this didn’t suit her either. Kayla felt like something was missing in her life until she found a career caring for animals. Now, she couldn’t imagine herself doing anything else. Everyday she spends caring for animals brings her great joy and satisfaction.</p>
