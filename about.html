    <h2>About Me: Kayla, Owner of Forever Love Pet Care</h2>

    <p>In one sentence you could summarize me as an animal lover who is considered by many as a loving and creative person. In my spare time I love spending time with my husband, dog (River) and cat (luna). I also enjoy making crafts, baking and spending time with family.</p>

    <p>I was born and raised in Loveland where I was constantly around animals. Over that time caring for animals quickly became my passion. I've always known I wanted a future with animals but didn’t know the direction I wanted to take.</p>

    <p>After high school I went to cosmetology school to become a hair stylist. After two years the initial feeling of excitement was dimmed as I realized cosmetology wasn’t for me. so I moved on and got a job in retail. As you can guess, this didn’t suit me either. I felt like something was missing in my life until I found a career caring for animals. Now, I couldn’t imagine myself doing anything else. Everyday I spends caring for animals brings me great joy and satisfaction.</p>
